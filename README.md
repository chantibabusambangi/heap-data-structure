# heap-data-structure
1.**two types of heaps**-> 1.max heap and min heap

  **max heap**-> the parent node value is greater than or equal to its children's node values.
  
  **min heap**-> the parent node value is lesser than or equal to its children's node values.

2.**structure of heap**

  it follows the **complete binary tree** structure.
  
  all nodes have two children,except the last level and last level is as left as possible.
  
this is all about a basic info.

just checkout the Max_heap.py file for working of heap.

and dont miss time complexity this is the most important one.
